# Geometry optimization for (AlH3)n cluster

! PBE 	# functional used for the MOF calculations later (non-expensive)
! RKS	# closed shell for AlH3
! D3BJ  # better geometries at low cost
! pc-3 	# proven basiset from earlier work
! Freq 	# Frequency analysis to check the stabiltity of the structures


! NoPop # population analysis not necessary	

! RI 		# speed up calculation 
! AutoAux # no auxiliary basis set for pc implemented
! DEFGRID3 # dense integration grid in space
! TightSCF # 
! TightOpt # thight convergence criteria for geometry optimizations

! SmallPrint
