- began with calc on very tight conv. criteria and pc-3
- demanding geometry optimization not convergig in the default number of steps

- started a loose optimization in looseCalc continued from last optimized geometry and same parameters in looseCalc2

- the result geometry was object of a tight optimization in tightCalc
