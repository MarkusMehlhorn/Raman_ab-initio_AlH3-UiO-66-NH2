# Pre Geometry optimization for (AlH3)n cluster
# ... continued

! PBE 	# functional used for the MOF calculations later (non-expensive)
! RKS	# closed shell for AlH3
! D3BJ  # better geometries at low cost
! pc-2 	# smaller basiset for preoptimization
! Freq 	# Frequency analysis to check the stabiltity of the structures


! NoPop # population analysis not necessary	

! RI 		# speed up calculation 
! AutoAux # no auxiliary basis set for pc implemented
! DEFGRID2 # normal integration grid in space
! NormalSCF # 
! NormalOpt # normal convergence criteria for pre geometry optimizations

! SmallPrint


* xyzFile 0 1 run.xyz # only maingroup elements H and Al so there should be no net spin
