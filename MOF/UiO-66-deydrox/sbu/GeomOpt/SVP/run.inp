! PBE 	# functional used for the MOF calculations later (non-expensive)
! RKS	# closed shell for SBU
! D3  # better geometries at low cost
! def2-SV(P) # Ahlrichs basis set triple zeta with core potentials and auxilarry basis set for coulomb integrals
! Freq 	# Frequency analysis to check the stabiltity of the structures

! NoPop # population analysis not necessary	

! RI 		# speed up calculation 
! DEFGRID2 # dense Grid
! NormalSCF # tight SCF criteria as basis for Geom.-Opt.
