# Geometry optimization for UiO-66-dehydrox SBU

%pal nprocs 64 end

! PBE 	# functional used for the MOF calculations later (non-expensive)
! RKS	# closed shell for SBU
! D3BJ  # better geometries at low cost
! def-SV(P) def-ECP def2/J  	# Ahlrichs basis set with core potentials ans auxilarry basis set for coulomb integrals
! Freq 	# Frequency analysis to check the stabiltity of the structures

! NoPop # population analysis not necessary	

! RI 		# speed up calculation 
! DEFGRID2 # medium Grid
! TightSCF # tight SCF criteria as basis for Geom.-Opt.
! NormalOpt # normal convergence criteria for geometry optimizations
